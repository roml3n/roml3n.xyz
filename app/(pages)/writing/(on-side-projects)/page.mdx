# On Side Projects

Building side projects has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my journey as a developer.
They're not just about writing code – they're about learning, experimenting, and growing.

## Why Side Projects Matter

1. **Learning by Doing**: There's no better way to learn than by building something real
2. **Creative Freedom**: No deadlines, no requirements – just pure exploration
3. **Portfolio Building**: Show, don't tell

## My Approach

I treat every side project as an experiment. Some fail, some succeed, but I always learn something new.

```typescript
// Example of learning through code
const life = {
  learn: () => "constantly",
  build: () => "fearlessly",
  grow: () => "inevitably",
};
```

Want to start your own side project? Just pick something you're excited about and start building!
