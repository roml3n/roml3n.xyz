              Overview="Tucheze, an online sports and casino betting platform, needed a visual experience in order to match the excitement of live sports and high-stakes games. With solid user research and foundational UX insights already established, my role was to instil the excitement and immediacy of a game-day atmosphere into the interface through strategic visual design. The core goal was to create a UI that provided immediate excitement and let users easily move between dynamic games, live betting, and real-time score updates."

                  The redesign increased user engagement: longer session times
                  and higher interaction rates with key features, including
                  quick-bet options. Users praised the dynamic visuals and
                  intuitive layout of the platform, making it exciting but easy
                  to navigateâ€”both true for the fast pace of sports betting.

                  This project really cemented the importance of striking the
                  right balance between visual flair and usability. It forced me
                  to think about creating a design that was not only functional
                  but also emotionally engaging, taught me how thoughtful
                  visuals could really raise the bar for user experience and
                  drive results.
