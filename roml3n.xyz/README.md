# The roml3n portfolio:2025 Edition

The saying, "your personal website is never done", is true. You always find yourself adding new things, new interactions or performance boosts. It's a healthy(I think) obsession that almost every designer and developer I know falls prey to. Every year, I also fall victim to this obsession, and I find myself setting out to build a new verison–a better one– of my digital portfolio. It's grown a lot over the years, and this is what it is now.

I'm using React.js and Tailwind to build this, and debated for a long time whether or not to fully commit to building it on Next instead. React won.
