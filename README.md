# 🪴 My Personal Portfolio

Hi there, curious internet wanderer 👋

This is the codebase for [my portfolio website](https://roml3n.xyz) –– a digital garden where I plant my product design case studies, sporadic blog posts, and some easter eggs for good measure.

I wanted the site to be as I am: unpretentious but thoughtful, playful in the right areas, and just polished enough to be able to say *"yes, I know what I'm doing"* without yelling it from the rooftops.

## 🧩 What's Inside

- ✍️ Case studies of work that I've done  
- 📓 A blog section (currently basic JSX routes — intention is to hook it up with MDX or Payload soon)  
- ✨ Some micro-interactions and visual flair I added in for vibes  
- 🌀 Inspiration from other designers and websites I love  

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  

Nothing too fancy — just good ol' modern frontend dev.

## 📚 Bonus Reading

If you're into semi-structured design ramblings, I also write over on [my Substack](https://substack.com/@roml3n) and over yonder [on Medium](https://medium.com/@romlen). It's where I spit out thoughts too weird or spicy for client meetings.

## 🧪 Still Cooking

- [ ] Integrate an actual CMS (eyeballing Payload or MDX)  
- [ ] Add more case studies  
- [ ] Optimize accessibility + performance scores (currently soaring over the high 90s)
- [ ] For real, actually write more blogs lol

Thanks for taking a read. If you do fork or clone this and turn it into something cool, let me know!
